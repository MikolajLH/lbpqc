# Primitives Submodule

The `primitives` submodule implements various mathematical objects and algorithms, that are used in a field of **lattice based cryptography and cryptanalysis**.  

---

## [Integer](primitives/integer.md)
Functions operating on elements from $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_q$ rings.

## [Lattice](primitives/lattice.md)
Functions operating on Lattices. Lattice's reductions and embeddings.

## [Polynomial](primitives/polynomial.md)
Functions operating on elements from various polynomial rings.

## [RNG](primitives/rng.md)
Module implementing random number generator with various samplers e.g. **Discrete Gaussian** as well as random prime number with arbitrary bit size.

## [Matrix](primitives/matrix.md)
Module implementing operation on integer matrices -  $M(\mathbb{Z})$ and $M(\mathbb{Z}_q)$.
